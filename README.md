# MEUScripts
Contains (almost) all of the Lua scripts for [Mass Effect: Unification](http://www.moddb.com/mods/the-mass-effect-mod), a total-conversion mod for Star Wars Battlefront II.

###Notes
Scripts headed with a Pandemic Studios copyright are not my original work, even though I've significantly altered and added to virtually all of them. The Pandemic Studios copyright header looks like this:
```lua
