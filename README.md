# MEUScripts
Contains (almost) all of the Lua scripts for [Mass Effect: Unification](http://www.moddb.com/mods/the-mass-effect-mod), a total-conversion mod for Star Wars Battlefront II.

###Notes
Scripts headed with a Pandemic Studios copyright are not my original work, even though I've significantly altered and added to virtually all of them. Their header looks like this:
```lua
--
-- Copyright (c) 2005 Pandemic Studios, LLC. All rights reserved.
--
```
In contrast, scripts headed with my own header are entirely my own original work. The header generally looks like this:
```lua
